# RTL Support for GitHub Copilot Chat in VSCode

A simple script to enable **Right-to-Left (RTL)** support for the GitHub Copilot Chat panel in Visual Studio Code, optimized for Persian (Farsi) and other RTL languages.

## Features

- Applies RTL direction to the chat interface
- Right-aligns input text for better readability
- Uses the Persian-friendly [Vazir font](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazir-font)
- Preserves LTR direction for code blocks
- Clean and minimal styling for better UX

## Preview

Here is an example of the result after applying the script:

## Usage

1. Make sure GitHub Copilot Chat is installed and enabled in your VSCode.

2. Open the **Developer Console** in VSCode:

   ```
   Help > Toggle Developer Tools > Console
   ```

3. Open the file [`rtl-fix.js`](./rtl-fix.js) and copy its contents.

4. Paste the code directly into the console and press `Enter`.

5. The Copilot Chat interface will now appear RTL-friendly. üéâ

## Notes

- The effect is temporary and will reset when you reload or reopen VSCode.
- You can repeat the same process each time you want to apply the RTL styling.
- Make sure the [Vazir font](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazir-font) is installed on your system for best results.

- [ ] Fix issue where LTR blocks sometimes disappear
- [ ] Improve RTL support for the question input area
- [ ] Add toggle to switch between RTL and LTR
- [ ] Convert script into a standalone VSCode extension
